            Starting a blog might seem like a lot of work. You might have a lot of doubts and questions like:
            <br>
            What am I going to write about?<br>
            What content will I put up?<br>
            Nobody is going to read my work.<br>
            I am not a writer.<br>
            I don't know anything about setting up a website.<br>
            Initially, I had these doubts too. I had started a blog about music four years ago. I had written a few articles on the blog. Nobody really read them. Eventually, the website collapsed due to some security issues and I didn't bother
            getting
            it back.<br><br>

            Even though my first blog was a massive failure, I learned a lot from it. I learned things like setting up a WordPress website, writing articles, marketing them, and a lot of other blog-related stuff.

            Had I not started and failed at my first blog, I would have never been able to start this one.

            Common Myths About Blogging
            Before getting into the reasons to start a blog, let us first look into some of the most common myths about starting a blog.
            <br><br>
            Myth #1: You Have to Be a Writer To Start a Blog
            Most people think that they have to know how to write great articles to start a blog. I used to think the same way. But, that's not entirely true.

            What is a blog? In simple terms, it a website where you share information, ideas, and thoughts with others. But it is important to share genuine and useful information with people. Your content must provide some value to them. And, to do
            so, you don't have to be a professional writer.

            But why blogging? That's a good question.

            We are living in the age of information. With the help of the internet, sharing information is easier than ever. The simple answer to the question, "Why blog?" is to share information. Everybody has things to share. Every single
            individual
            is unique. He or she has skills, interests, thoughts, feelings, ideas that can be shared with others and that could even help others.

            There are plenty of niches you can blog about. Pick one that interests you. If you are not sure, then just write about whatever you want at first, just like I did. Slowly, you will know where your interest lies more and what kind of
            content
            your readers enjoy. Then, you can figure out what you will be writing about.
            <br><br>
            Myth #2: You Need Your Own Website
            You don't. There are plenty of online platforms to write on. For starters, you can begin with Blogger, WordPress, Medium, LinkedIn, Wix, etc. You only have to sign up and create your account on these platforms. Then, you can write as many
            articles as you want and share them with others.

            But if you are seriously considering blogging, it is better to have a website. Building a website has become easier than ever. There are plenty of free lessons on YouTube on how you can create a website for your blog in less than 10
            minutes
            using platforms like WordPress and Wix.

            If you are just starting out, I would suggest you write on the above-mentioned platforms first. Once you are comfortable with writing articles and sharing them, you can transform them into a blog of your own later.
